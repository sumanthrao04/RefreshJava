What is the difference between overloading and overriding with respect to exception handling?

Can an overridden method throw a broader checked exception than the base method?

Explain how the type of the reference vs. the object determines method execution.

What happens if the base class has a method, but the subclass does not override it?

How are polymorphic method calls optimized by the JIT compiler?
