Who Creates the Object in Java?
* The new Keyword
* new is the operator that actually creates the object in memory (on the heap).
* It allocates memory, sets aside space for instance variables, and then calls the constructor.
             Book b = new Book();
* new allocates memory for Book object.
* Book() constructor is invoked to initialize the object.

The Constructor
* Constructor does not create the object.
* Its job is to initialize the object after memory is allocated.
* Without a constructor, you can still allocate memory using new (compiler provides a default one).


Object creation without new:
* Using Class.forName() (reflection)
* Using clone()
* Using deserialization
* Using newInstance()
