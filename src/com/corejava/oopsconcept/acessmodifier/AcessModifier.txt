Access Modifiers in Java

ðŸŽ¯ Real-World Interview Questions on Access Modifiers (Java, 4 Years Exp)
ðŸ”¹ Core Understanding
1.	What are the different access modifiers in Java and how do they affect class, method, and variable visibility?
2.	Can a class be private in Java? Why or why not?
3.	What happens if you don't specify any access modifier? What is the default visibility?
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ OOP and Design Questions
4.	Youâ€™re designing a class with internal helper methods. Which access modifier will you use for those methods and why?
5.	In a large application, you want some fields to be modifiable only within the class. Which access modifier will you use and how will other classes access them if needed?
6.	Can you explain how access modifiers support encapsulation in OOP?

ðŸ”¹ Package & Inheritance Use Cases
7.	How does protected differ from default/package-private in terms of inheritance?
8.	Can a subclass in a different package access a protected member of a superclass? Show with an example.
9.	How would you design a utility class in Java with constants and helper methods so it can be reused across packages but not instantiated?

ðŸ”¹ Practical Scenarios
10.	Suppose you have a base class Employee in one package and a subclass Manager in another. How would you expose certain fields only to subclasses but not to unrelated classes?
11.	You're working in a microservices codebase where several modules use shared DTOs. What access modifiers would you choose for fields and methods in those DTOs?

ðŸ”¹ Trick/Advanced Questions
12.	Can a protected method be overridden with a public modifier? Explain why it's allowed.
13.	Can an outer class be protected in Java? Why or why not?
14.	What is the accessibility of an inner private static class and when would you use it?
15.	How do access modifiers behave in interfaces (Java 8+)? Can you have private methods in interfaces?
