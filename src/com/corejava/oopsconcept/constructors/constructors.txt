ðŸ”¹ Deep-Dive Constructor Interview Questions
âœ… Basic-Level
1.	What is a constructor and how does it differ from a method in Java?
2.	Can a constructor be final, static, or synchronized?
3.	What happens if you donâ€™t define any constructor in a class?
4.	Can constructors be inherited? Why or why not?
5.	Can you make a constructor private? When is this useful?

âœ… Intermediate-Level
6.	Explain constructor overloading with an example.
7.	What is constructor chaining in Java? How is it implemented?
8.	How does the this() keyword work in constructor chaining?
9.	Can you call a constructor from a method? Why or why not?
10.	What is the role of super() in a constructor?
o	When does it get called?
o	What happens if you donâ€™t explicitly write super()?

âœ… Advanced-Level / Real-World Use Cases
11.	How are constructors used in dependency injection in Spring?
12.	Why is constructor injection preferred over setter injection in Spring?
13.	Explain a situation where you used a constructor to enforce business rules.
14.	You have a class with 6 required and 3 optional fields. How would you design the constructor?
o	Expect answer: Builder pattern, or constructor chaining with overloads.
15.	What are telescoping constructors? How do you avoid them?
16.	How do constructors help in creating immutable classes in Java?
17.	How does the JVM know which constructor to call at runtime?
18.	What will happen if you call this() and super() in the same constructor?
o	(Answer: Compilation error â€” must be the first statement)
19.	Can we define a constructor in an abstract class? Can we instantiate it directly?
o	(Yes to defining, No to instantiating)
20.	How do constructors behave in inheritance when there is no default constructor in the parent class?

âœ… Practical Scenario-Based Questions
21.	You are using Lombok in a project. How does Lombok generate constructors and how do you customize it?
22.	Can you provide an example of constructor misuse you've seen in code, and how you corrected it?
23.	In a microservice, how would you design a DTO class that needs validation logic on creation?
o	(Expected: Use constructor with validations or factory methods)
24.	Is it a good practice to perform business logic inside constructors? Why or why not?
25.	Have you ever used a factory method or builder pattern to replace constructors? Why was it necessary?
