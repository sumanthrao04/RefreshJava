âœ… Advanced-Level / Real-World Use Cases
11.	How are constructors used in dependency injection in Spring?
12.	Why is constructor injection preferred over setter injection in Spring?
13.	Explain a situation where you used a constructor to enforce business rules.
14.	You have a class with 6 required and 3 optional fields. How would you design the constructor?
o	Expect answer: Builder pattern, or constructor chaining with overloads.
15.	What are telescoping constructors? How do you avoid them?
16.	How do constructors help in creating immutable classes in Java?
17.	How does the JVM know which constructor to call at runtime?
18.	What will happen if you call this() and super() in the same constructor?
o	(Answer: Compilation error â€” must be the first statement)
19.	Can we define a constructor in an abstract class? Can we instantiate it directly?
o	(Yes to defining, No to instantiating)
20.	How do constructors behave in inheritance when there is no default constructor in the parent class?

âœ… Practical Scenario-Based Questions
21.	You are using Lombok in a project. How does Lombok generate constructors and how do you customize it?
22.	Can you provide an example of constructor misuse you've seen in code, and how you corrected it?
23.	In a microservice, how would you design a DTO class that needs validation logic on creation?
o	(Expected: Use constructor with validations or factory methods)
24.	Is it a good practice to perform business logic inside constructors? Why or why not?
25.	Have you ever used a factory method or builder pattern to replace constructors? Why was it necessary?



Why Constructor Cannot Be abstract
* Abstract methods are meant to be overridden by child classes.
* A constructor cannot be inherited or overridden â€” each class defines its own constructor.
* Hence, making a constructor abstract has no meaning

Why Constructor Cannot Be static
* static means something belongs to the class rather than an object.
* But constructors are used to create objects â€” they run when an object is being created.
* If a constructor were static, it would mean you can call it without creating an object, which is contradictory

Why Constructor Cannot Be final
* final in Java means cannot be overridden.
* But constructors are not inherited, hence they cannot be overridden in subclasses.
* So making them final has no purpose.

Why Constructor Cannot Be synchronized
* synchronized ensures that only one thread can access a method at a time.
* But constructors are not shared like methods â€” each call creates a separate new object.
* So multiple threads calling new Book() donâ€™t interfere with each other.
* Synchronizing constructors is meaningless â€” instead, you synchronize shared resources.
* If you need thread-safety during object creation, use: Singleton pattern with synchronized block

The Constructor
* Constructor does not create the object.
* Its job is to initialize the object after memory is allocated.
* Without a constructor, you can still allocate memory using new (compiler provides a default one).


Can constructors be inherited?
* No. Every class defines its own constructors.

Can a constructor return a value?
* No, not explicitly. But object reference is returned by new.

Can constructor be private?
* Yes â†’ used in Singleton pattern or factory methods.

Can constructor throw exceptions?
* Yes, can declare throws clause.

Order of constructor execution in inheritance?
* Parent class constructor executes first, then child class constructor.

Difference between Constructor and Method
* Constructor â†’ no return type, auto-called, same name as class.
*Method â†’ has return type, explicitly called, name can vary.

What happens if you donâ€™t define any constructor in a class?
